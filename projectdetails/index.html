		<h1>The Crossroads of Film</h1>
		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>For our project, we are building a movie recommendation/search service. It is a movie organizer that tracks movie data including actors, ratings, awards, etc. that will give recommendations based on different measures of similarity from multiple sources and provide users with the ability to access and filter this movie information.  
		Users will have the ability create an account and like different movies.  Users will also be able to follow other
		users and get recommendations for movies to watch based on the likes of users they follow.</p>
		<h2>Usefulness</h2>
		<p>Often, when thinking about or discussing movies, you'd like to be able to search for movies by various fields (actors, time-frame, directors, etc). Additionally, you'd like to get recommendations for movies based on movies that your friends enjoy. We'd like to build a service that fufills all our movie search/recommendation needs. Rather than having to use IMBD to get movie data then a different form of social media to get recommendations, we want to bundle it all into one helpful web application. Ideally, we want our service to allow users to search for movies and actors in creative ways.  For example, if your movie night is centered around watching an adventure movie that has won best picture, then you will be able to pull up a list of movies that fit those specifications.</p>
		<h2>Realness</h2>
		<p>The majority of our movie data will come from the IMDb dataset (http://www.imdb.com/interfaces). We will use the movie data, actor/actresses data, genre data, ratings data, and "appears in" data from IMBD.  We will then use user data from external users including movie "likes" and follower data.</p>
		<h2>Functionalities</h2>
		<h3>Basic Functions</h3>
		<p>
		Inserting: Our web application will consist of a login where a user can create an account which inserts credentials into the Users database.  The user will also be able to insert a new movie if it is not already included in the database by using the "Insert" button on the lower right hand side of the homepage.<br>
		Updating: Our web application will allow users to rate movies.  This will update the rating to account for the additional rating. <br>
		Searching: The user will be able search for a movie which will return a list of all the movies that contain the search criteria in the name. The user can also search on actor to return all movies with that actor.  This query consists of a join on the Movies and Actors tables.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Advanced Functions</h3>
		<p>
		Advanced Search: This will provide the user the ability to craft their own creative searches.  We provide some examples below to illustrate use cases. <br>
		<ol>
        	<li>Search for all movies with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen between 2000 and 2010.</li>
        	<li>Search for the highest rated romantic comedies within the past 10 years.</li>
        	<li>What are the lowest rated movies in the past 10 years with Anne Hathaway.</li>
        	<li>Search for high rated war movies with specific actors.</li>
        </ol><br>
        Collaborative Filtering: This will allow users to log in to the site and 'like' different movies.  The user will also be able to follow different users and get recommendations of movies to watched based on the 'likes' of the users they are following.
